# Lucas-Kanade-Object-Tracking-and-Correlation-Filters

This project consists of five sections:  
1) A simple Lucas-Kanade (LK) tracker with one single template   
2) The tracker is generalized to accommodate for large appearance variance.   
3) The third section requires you to implement a motion subtraction method for tracking moving pixels in a scene. 
4) Efficient tracking using inverse composition.
5) Efficient tracking using correlation filters.
